# eXtensible Twitch Bot

A twitch bot framework written in Node.js using tmi.js,
designed to be efficient and flexible.

## Example Bot
A working example of how you can use `xtb` can be found at
[`amccarthy1/xtb-example`](https://github.com/amccarthy1/xtb-example).

## Usage (for programmers)
API documentation Coming Soon&trade;
(Really though the source is dead simple at this point. Check out `extbot.js`)

## Words of Warning
This bot is still under development. There are rate-limiting options in place to
avoid temporary global bans, but not to prevent "You are sending messages too
quickly" responses.
